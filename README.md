<h2 align="left" > Description</h2>

The Mangalavya is an **RFID Based Restaurant Food Ordering System** ,initially made for 24 hour hackathon at  SRM University 
- It is a web-based system that generates a token using RFID technology.
- The token is transferred to the user, and a 3D model-based ordering system is shown to them.
- The project is based on a Utopian theme inspired by Elon Musk's vision of life on Mars in 2050.- 
- The system eliminates the need for waiters in the restaurant.
- The aim is to provide an innovative and futuristic dining experience to customers.
